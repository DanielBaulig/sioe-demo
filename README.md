# _socket.io and Express. Tying it all together. Demo Application_

This is a demo application demonstrating how the two popular frameworks socket.io and Express can be effectively used together.

Please read my article [socket.io and Express. Tying it all together.](http://www.danielbaulig.de/socket-ioexpress) for details on what is going on.

Note: This demo was written for Express 2.x and does not longer translate 1:1 to newer versions of Express. The basic principles still apply, but the Express APIs have slightly changed since then.

# Installation

    npm install sioe-demo

# Run

    make run
